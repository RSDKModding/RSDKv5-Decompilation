A complete decompilation of Retro Engine v5 and v5Ultimate.

# **SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS OF THE RETRO ENGINE**
We do not own the Retro Engine in any way, shape or form, and this project would not have been possible had they not developed RSDKv5 in the first place. Retro Engine is currently owned by [Evening Star](https://eveningstar.studio/); we highly urge you to follow & support their projects if you enjoyed this project of ours!

## **DO NOT USE THIS DECOMPILATION PROJECT AS A MEANS TO PIRATE SONIC MANIA OR ANY OTHER RSDKv5 GAMES.**
We do not condone using this project as a means for piracy in any form. This project was made with love and care for the source material and was created for purely educational purposes.

# Additional Tweaks
* Added a built-in mod loader and API allowing to easily create and play mods with features such as save file redirection and XML asset loading, supported by all sub-versions of v5U.
* 
* Added a built-in shader compiler for backends/platforms that support it.
* Added various other backends to windows aside from the usual DirectX 9 backends

# How to Build
Firstly, follow the steps in [the common dependency readme](./dependencies/all/README.md) to install the common dependencies, then follow the steps for your platform of choice.

## [Windows](./dependencies/windows/README.md)

## [Linux](./dependencies/linux/README.md)

## [Mac](./dependencies/linux/README.md)

## [Android](./dependencies/android/README.md)

### Other Platforms
Currently, the only officially supported platforms are the ones listed above. However, the backend is very modular, so the codebase is very multiplatform.

# FAQ
### Q: The screen is tearing, how do I fix it?
A: Try turning on VSync in settings.ini.

### Q: I found a bug/I have a feature request!
A: Submit an issue in the issues tab and we _might_ fix it in the main branch. Don't expect any major future releases, however.

### Q: Is there a decompilation for RSDKv3 and/or RSDKv4?
A: There is! You can find RSDKv3 [here](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-CD-11-Decompilation) and RSDKv4 [here](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation).

### Q: Will there be a decompilation for any other RSDK versions?
A: No. This is the last decompilation from us. This project took about 1 and a half years to do, and with it completed, we're ready to move onto other endeavours rather than continue decompiling programs forever.

### Q: Are there anymore decompilation projects in the works?
A: Absolutely not. Between the last two and this one, we're done with decompiling, at least for the time being. Please do not expect any more decompilations from us, Sonic or otherwise!
